Excel-based credit scorecard model for MSMEs
# MSME Credit Risk Scorecard Modeling

A simulation project that builds a credit risk evaluation system for **MSMEs (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises)** using a structured **scorecard model**. The model evaluates small businesses across financial, operational, and behavioral dimensions to generate:

-  risk score (0–100)  
-  risk grade (A1 to C)  
-  A funding eligibility decision (Eligible / Conditionally Eligible / Decline)

 Project Objective

To design and implement a **comprehensive credit risk scorecard** that mimics real-world loan appraisal systems used by banks and NBFCs — helping assess borrower creditworthiness using objective and data-driven criteria.

Methodology

The project was built in **Microsoft Excel** using formulas, logic rules, and charts to simulate a digital credit scorecard. The process was divided into six stages:

Selection of Parameters
13 MSME-specific parameters were grouped under 5 key pillars:
- **Financial Strength** (e.g., Avg. Bank Balance, EMI burden)
- **Operational Stability** (e.g., Years in business, Employee count)
- **Tax Compliance** (e.g., GST Filing, ITR)
- **Digital Behavior** (e.g., UPI Usage, Mobile Recharge Patterns)
- **Promoter/Business Reputation**

Parameter Scoring
Each input was normalized and scored from **0–100** based on risk thresholds.

> Example:  
> Bank Balance > ₹1,00,000 → Score = 100  
> Irregular GST Filing → Score = 40 or lower

Weight Assignment
Weights were assigned to each parameter (e.g., Avg Bank Balance = 10%, GST Filing = 5%), summing to **100%**.

Learnings & Impact

This project demonstrates how a data-driven, rule-based scorecard system can:
>Improve MSME lending accuracy
>Reduce manual underwriting time
>Promote financial inclusion using alternate data
>Align with formal credit scoring frameworks used by banks
